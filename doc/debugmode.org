* ET-312 Debug Mode

The ET-312 has a built in diagnostic screen which looks like it is used when
boxes are commissioned.

To access it you need to link the tx and rx puns of a 3.5mm jack plug inserted
into the 'link' socket, then turn on the box with a factory reset (holding the bottom
two buttons as you turn the box on).  8 numbers will be displayed and updated:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
241 160  00  00
 41  39  37 171
#+END_EXAMPLE

From top left these are:

- port D input value (i.e. which buttons are being pushed)
- battery voltage (from ADC3)
- Audio A input level (from ADC7)
- Audio B input level (from ADC6)
- Channel A FET calibration level
- Channel B FET calibration level
- MA knob level (from ADC1)
- OCDR register
